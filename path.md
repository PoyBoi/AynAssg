# The path I took:

1. [x] Setup the repo to work in it
2. [x] Turning the model into a diffuser model
3. [x] Turned it into a pipeline
4. [x] Loaded the diffusor model
 - Trying these models:
    - [ ] clarity_3
    - [ ] dreamshaper_8
    - [ ] [realisticVision_6](https://huggingface.co/SG161222/Realistic_Vision_V6.0_B1_noVAE)
5. [x] Wrote argparser for CLI
6. [ ] Lora
    > Try these:
    - negative embeddings lora's
7. [ ] Make a model selector menu that reads models from the diffused folder
