# The path I took:

1.  [x] Setup the repo to work in it
2.  [x] Turning the model into a diffuser model
3.  [x] Turned it into a pipeline
4.  [x] Loaded the diffusor model
 - Trying these models:
    - [ ] clarity_3
    - [ ] dreamshaper_8
    - [ ] [realisticVision_6](https://huggingface.co/SG161222/Realistic_Vision_V6.0_B1_noVAE)
5.  [x] Wrote argparser for CLI
6.  [ ] Finish the path from the article
7.  [x] Need to fix the argparse in main.py
8.  [ ] Need to add save location
9.  [ ] Add real-ESRGAN
10. [ ] Error Handling
11. [ ] Lora
    > Try these:
    - negative embeddings lora's
12. [ ] Make a model selector menu that reads models from the diffused folder
